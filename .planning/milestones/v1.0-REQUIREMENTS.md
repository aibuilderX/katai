## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Built-in image/video editor | Canva has 1000+ engineers on this; focus on generation, not editing |
| Social media scheduling | Buffer/Hootsuite domain; export platform-ready assets instead |
| Model fine-tuning per customer | Expensive, slow, maintenance burden; use in-context learning instead |
| Multi-language support | JP-specific features ARE the moat; diluting to English weakens positioning |
| Real-time collaboration | JP agency workflows are sequential (ringi), not simultaneous |
| Blockchain/NFT | Zero user value; standard DB versioning provides audit trail |
| Mobile native app | Web-first; JP agencies review on mobile browser |
| CRM integration | Salesforce/HubSpot connectors deferred to post-v2 |
| A/B testing analytics | Requires ad platform integration not in v1 |
| Ad bidding optimization | Requires performance data pipeline not in v1 |
