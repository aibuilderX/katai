<objective>
Build the first two agent n8n sub-workflows (Strategic Insight and Creative Director) and the quality gate, then wire them into the Master Orchestrator.

Purpose: These are the first agents in the pipeline. Strategic Insight classifies the campaign brief into Schwartz awareness level, LF8 desires, and copywriting framework (PAS/AIDA/BAB/AIDMA/AISAS). Creative Director generates the visual and copy direction. The quality gate ensures Strategic Insight output is complete before passing to Creative Director. Both are critical-stop agents -- pipeline halts if they fail after 1 retry.

Output: 2 n8n sub-workflows (Strategic Insight, Creative Director) and a quality gate code node, all wired into the Master Orchestrator from Plan 09-01.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Strategic Insight agent n8n sub-workflow with quality gate</name>
  <files>
    (n8n workflows via MCP)
  </files>
  <action>
Create a new n8n sub-workflow "Strategic Insight Agent" using `n8n_create_workflow`:

**Workflow structure:**

1. **Execute Workflow Trigger** — receives PipelineState JSON from Master Orchestrator

2. **Send Progress: Active** (HTTP Request node):
   - POST to NEXTJS_CALLBACK_URL with agentStep: { agentName: "strategic_insight", labelJa: "戦略分析中", status: "active", startedAt: ISO timestamp }
   - Include HMAC signature header

3. **Build Prompt** (Code node):
   - Extract brief, brandProfile, agentConfig from PipelineState input
   - The prompt builder logic from `src/lib/ai/prompts/agents/strategic-insight.ts` cannot run in n8n directly (it's TypeScript with imports). Instead, inline the essential prompt content:
     - System prompt: Role as strategic marketing analyst, embedded Schwartz awareness level definitions (Unaware/Problem Aware/Solution Aware/Product Aware/Most Aware), LF8 desires list, Japanese desire nuances (wa, bi_ishiki, anshin), all 5 copywriting frameworks (PAS/AIDA/BAB/AIDMA/AISAS) with selection criteria
     - User message: Brief objective, target audience, product info, brand profile, platforms, mood tags
     - Tool schema: `deliver_strategic_insight` with all required fields (awarenessLevel, lf8Desires, copywritingFramework, targetInsight, creativeDirection, keyMessages, tonalGuidance, summaryJa, confidence scores)
     - tool_choice: { type: "tool", name: "deliver_strategic_insight" }
   - Model from agentConfig.strategicInsight.model (default: claude-opus-4-6)
   - Temperature: 0.2 (analytical agent per Phase 9.1 decision)
   - Max tokens: 4096
   - IMPORTANT: Do NOT reference SB7 anywhere in the prompt. Only PAS/AIDA/BAB/AIDMA/AISAS.
   - Include instruction: "Summarize your decision in ~10 words in Japanese for the summaryJa field"

4. **Call Anthropic API** (HTTP Request node):
   - POST to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`
   - Headers: x-api-key (from n8n Anthropic credential), anthropic-version: 2023-06-01, content-type: application/json
   - Body: the constructed messages request with tools and tool_choice
   - Timeout: 120 seconds

5. **Parse Response** (Code node):
   - Extract tool_use content block from response
   - Parse the JSON input from the deliver_strategic_insight tool call
   - Write to pipelineState.strategicInsight
   - Calculate cost entry: inputTokens, outputTokens from response usage, costYen estimated from token counts
   - Extract summaryJa for progress callback

6. **Quality Gate** (Code node — ORCH-09):
   - Validate the parsed StrategicInsightOutput:
     - awarenessLevel is one of: "unaware", "problem_aware", "solution_aware", "product_aware", "most_aware"
     - lf8Desires has at least 1 entry
     - copywritingFramework is one of: "PAS", "AIDA", "BAB", "AIDMA", "AISAS" (NOT SB7)
     - targetInsight length >= 10 chars
     - creativeDirection length >= 10 chars
   - If validation fails: set error flag, do NOT continue

7. **Error Handling — 1 Silent Retry** (using n8n's retry mechanism or an If node):
   - If the API call or quality gate fails on first attempt, retry once
   - If retry also fails: send failure callback with Japanese error message "戦略分析を完了できませんでした。お手数ですが、もう一度お試しください。" and halt (critical-stop)

8. **Send Progress: Complete** (HTTP Request node):
   - POST agentStep: { agentName: "strategic_insight", status: "complete", summaryJa: extracted summary, completedAt: ISO timestamp }
   - POST costEntries with token usage

9. **Return Updated PipelineState** — return to Master Orchestrator with strategicInsight populated

After creating the sub-workflow, update the Master Orchestrator (from Plan 09-01) to replace the Strategic Insight placeholder with an Execute Sub-workflow node referencing this workflow's ID. Use `n8n_update_partial_workflow` with an `updateNode` operation.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Sub-workflow created via n8n MCP and has valid structure
    - Quality gate validates all required fields
    - No reference to SB7 in any prompt content
    - Framework enum includes AIDMA and AISAS
    - Temperature is 0.2
    - Master Orchestrator updated to reference this sub-workflow
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Strategic Insight n8n sub-workflow calls Anthropic API with tool-use structured output
    - Quality gate (ORCH-09) validates awarenessLevel, lf8Desires, copywritingFramework, targetInsight, creativeDirection completeness
    - 1 silent retry on failure, then critical-stop with Japanese error message
    - Progress callbacks sent for active/complete states with cost entries
    - Master Orchestrator dispatches to this sub-workflow
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Creative Director agent n8n sub-workflow</name>
  <files>
    (n8n workflows via MCP)
  </files>
  <action>
Create a new n8n sub-workflow "Creative Director Agent" using `n8n_create_workflow`:

**Workflow structure:**

1. **Execute Workflow Trigger** — receives PipelineState JSON with strategicInsight populated

2. **Send Progress: Active** (HTTP Request):
   - agentStep: { agentName: "creative_director", labelJa: "クリエイティブ設計中", status: "active" }

3. **Build Prompt** (Code node):
   - Extract strategicInsight, brief, brandProfile, mode from PipelineState
   - System prompt: Role as creative director for Japanese advertising market, 5 Japanese creative conventions (indirectness, seasonal sensitivity, kawaii/cute aesthetic, wa/harmony, trust signals), composition and color guidance instructions
   - User message: Include strategicInsight (awarenessLevel, lf8Desires, copywritingFramework, creativeDirection, tonalGuidance), brief details, brandProfile
   - Tool schema: `deliver_creative_concept` — fields: concept, visualConcept, colorGuidance, compositionNotes, moodKeywords, copyDirection, platformAdaptations, summaryJa
   - For mode "pro": use the array wrapper tool schema with 2-3 concepts (minItems:2, maxItems:3)
   - For mode "auto": use flat single-concept tool schema
   - tool_choice: { type: "tool", name: "deliver_creative_concept" }
   - Model from agentConfig.creativeDirector.model
   - Temperature: 0.5 (creative agent per Phase 9.1 decision)
   - Max tokens: 4096

4. **Call Anthropic API** (HTTP Request node):
   - Same pattern as Strategic Insight
   - Timeout: 120 seconds

5. **Parse Response** (Code node):
   - Extract tool_use content block
   - For pro mode: take first concept from the array (the orchestrator only needs one concept to proceed; all concepts are stored in pipelineState for the dashboard)
   - Write to pipelineState.creativeDirector
   - Calculate cost entry

6. **Error Handling — 1 Silent Retry**:
   - If fails after retry: critical-stop with "クリエイティブの方向性を生成できませんでした。お手数ですが、もう一度お試しください。"

7. **Send Progress: Complete** (HTTP Request):
   - agentStep: { agentName: "creative_director", status: "complete", summaryJa }
   - costEntries

8. **Return Updated PipelineState** with creativeDirector populated

After creating, update Master Orchestrator to reference this sub-workflow ID in the Creative Director placeholder node.
  </action>
  <verify>
