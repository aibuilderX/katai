## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6-phase structure derived from 42 requirements; research-suggested Phase 7 (polish) deferred since all its features are v2 scope
- [Roadmap]: Phases 1-3 form image+copy MVP; Phase 4 adds video; Phases 5-6 add agency workflow and billing
- [01-04]: Sequential Flux image generation to avoid rate limiting (acceptable for Phase 1)
- [01-04]: Store Flux image URLs directly in assets table (no Supabase Storage upload in Phase 1)
- [01-04]: English image prompts for Flux (Japanese text compositing is Phase 2)
